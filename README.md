# Geometry-Dash
Geometry Dash was a popular video game that was created in 2013 and I decided to create it in Java. My version of this 
game is not as complex as the actual video game, but it has the basic objects and functions as the actual one. 
For all who have not played the game before:

The objective of the game is to get to the portal where when you touch it,
you have won the game. Press the up arrow to jump and
jump to different platforms and over spikes. 
When you hit the spikes and hit the sides of the different platforms (or blocks in other terms), you die and start over.
Last but not least, enjoy!
